# InterpretableBreastCancerPrognosis
Procedures for interpretable and reliable analysis of 5-years survival and recurrence of disease for breast cancer patients. 

This project represents a machine learning approach based on breast cancer patientsâ€™ data to estimate the survival period and recurrence of the disease. A vast number of parameters, ranging from clinical, histological, imaging, and molecular domains, were used to describe the characteristics of patients and their tumor biology in order to examine the manifestation of disease in a patient-specific manner.
Having a reliable system that provides the likelihood that the patient will survive less than 5 years or that she will suffer the recurrence of cancer,  and which additionally explains the specific factors that led to that decisions will provide clinicians the possibility to evaluate and compare expected benefits or risks of specific therapies in the initial stage of treatment.
